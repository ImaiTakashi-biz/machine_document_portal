# Google Sheets production setup

The application reads the `生産中` sheet using a Google Cloud service account. It does not require PostgreSQL. The dashboard displays only the non-empty machine IDs in column D; adding a machine ID to the sheet makes it appear after the next refresh, and removing it makes it disappear.

The latest sheet data is held only in the application process. A restart automatically fetches the sheet again; if Google Sheets is unavailable at startup, the dashboard remains empty until a later successful refresh. Synchronization history is not retained after restart.

## Spreadsheet layout

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| A | Production status |
| D | Machine ID |
| H | Part number |
| I | Product name |

Use machine IDs in the `group-number` form (for example, `A-1`) for the expected group and numeric sort order. New groups are supported. Duplicate machine IDs stop the sync.

## Google Cloud

1. Create a dedicated service account for this application in the production Google Cloud project.
2. Enable the Google Sheets API for that project.
3. Create a JSON key for the service account and place it on the application host as `secrets/google-service-account.json`.
4. Share the target spreadsheet with the service account's `client_email` as **Viewer**.

Never commit the key file. The `secrets/` directory is ignored by Git.

## NAS drawings

Set `NAS_DRAWING_DIRECTORY` to the directory containing drawing PDFs. The application looks for an exact filename match with the part number in column H, adding `.pdf` when the part number has no extension. When the user selects the drawing button, the application opens a dedicated browser tab and renders the first page as a JPEG preview; the PDF and NAS path are not exposed to the browser. Generated previews are cached while the application runs.

The separate-tab first-page preview is the current display mode. Split-screen display with the inspection sheet and multi-page navigation can be introduced later without changing the NAS lookup rule.

The account that starts the application must have read permission for the NAS directory.

For the SharePoint inspection-sheet setup, see [SHAREPOINT_INSPECTION_SHEETS.md](SHAREPOINT_INSPECTION_SHEETS.md).

## Production environment file

Create the ignored `.env` file on the application host. Substitute the key path and spreadsheet ID. The spreadsheet ID is the portion between `/d/` and `/edit` in its URL.

```dotenv
APP_ENV=production
DEBUG=false
USE_SAMPLE_DATA=false
PERSISTENCE_MODE=memory

GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=secrets/google-service-account.json
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID=replace-with-spreadsheet-id
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_SHEET_NAME=生産中
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_START_ROW=2
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_STATUS_COLUMN=A
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_MACHINE_COLUMN=D
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_PART_NUMBER_COLUMN=H
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_PRODUCT_NAME_COLUMN=I
NAS_DRAWING_DIRECTORY=\\server\share\drawings
AUTO_REFRESH_SECONDS=300
DOCUMENT_REFRESH_TIMES=10:30,14:30
```

## Deploy and verify

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the application. It performs a complete Google Sheets, SharePoint, and NAS refresh on startup, and the refresh button (or `POST /api/refresh`) performs the same refresh again. At the interval set by `AUTO_REFRESH_SECONDS`, the application reads Google Sheets and rechecks SharePoint/NAS only for machines whose part number is new or changed. `DOCUMENT_REFRESH_TIMES` performs a complete SharePoint/NAS-only refresh at comma-separated Japan-time values such as `10:30,14:30`; leave it blank to disable this schedule. Restart the application after editing `.env` so the new values are loaded. The service account has read-only access and the application never writes to the spreadsheet.

When `SCHEDULED_OPERATIONS_ENABLED=true`, the same spreadsheet is also inspected at 13:00 for the next available `〇〇S` sheet. The application reads `B40:K40`, sends missing SharePoint/NAS documents to ARAICHAT, and re-reads the same sheet at 15:00 before printing available NAS PDFs. Failed print submissions are retried after 3, 5, and 10 minutes when `PRINT_RETRY_DELAYS_SECONDS=180,300,600`. Keep scheduled operations disabled until ARAICHAT, NAS, and printer access have been verified on the production server. At cutover, stop the legacy print script or scheduled task first, enable scheduled operations before 13:00, and restart the NSSM service. Enabling the scheduler after 15:00 can start both of that day's operations immediately, so the legacy process and this application must not run in parallel.
